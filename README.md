# TransmitserviceTests
The purpose of this program is to quickly test the transmit service in a semi-automated fashion
To run you need
-Node version 10.48 or higher
-NPM
-NPM packages "newman" and "newman-reporter-html"
--Instructions on these Modules can be found here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman
-A Javascript IDE (Webstorm, Visual Studio Code) is recommended but not necessary

Assuming you are using Linux (can be WSL as well) after initializing the project simply navigate to the folder that the project resides and type "index.js".  
All this will do for now is generate an HTML report that will confirm that the tests were run.
